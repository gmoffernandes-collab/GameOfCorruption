## 🕊️ *Respect Beyond Corruption*  
### **“Was respect forgotten?”**

**Respect Beyond Corruption** is a narrative choice-based game that puts the player at the center of a world where the line between ethics and corruption has become almost invisible. With every decision — small or significant — the player shapes the fate of the characters and the society around them.

The slogan **“Was respect forgotten?”** echoes as a constant reminder that every action has consequences, and that respect, often overlooked, may be the key to transforming entire realities.

The game challenges players to reflect on morality, integrity, and power. There are no simple answers — only possible paths. Is it possible to remain honest in a corrupted system? Or does everyone eventually give in?

In **Respect Beyond Corruption**, every choice matters.  
And every choice reveals who we truly are.
